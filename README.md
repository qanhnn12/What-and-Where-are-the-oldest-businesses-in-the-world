# What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses
**SQL & Python projects on DataCamp**

*Use joining techniques to discover the oldest businesses in the world.*

## Project Description
An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the business survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this remarkably well and last for hundreds of years. In this project, you'll explore data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries do they belong to?

Like many business problems, the data we'll explore is contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, we will first need to use joining techniques to merge our data. From there, we can use manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.
